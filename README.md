This project is a fork of [Stompee](https://github.com/phillip-kruger/stompee) but san be 
used in a Servlet Container instead of a JEE container.

Zol adds the following features:

* The logged in user is added to log table 
* More filters allow to filter logs on threadId and user
* Option to limit the number of log records in the table so browser won't lock up (default 500 records)
